## Purpose ##

To provide more insight into the subreddit, "cscareerquestions", in particular salary info of the vocal demographic.
Reddit tends to be a polarizing community in which both Type A and struggling developers share the same platform.
This tool aims to show the discreptency in a self-reported, biased dataset between this unique demographic and the
outside world. 

## Disclaimer ## 

I am by no means suggesting anyone use this salary data to conduct their own business, research, or other professional
activities. This side-project is for self-interest _only_ and if information is taken outside of context it is up to
the reader to assume liability. 

## Contribute ##

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you found the tool lacking! If there is a particular feature you would like to add
just fork the repository and open a pull request.

## Who am I? ##

You can find more info about me on my personal website: vinchou.surge.sh. It's currently a bit broken on mobile devices
so I'd encourage a visit on a desktop. Oh, and also the resume was removed recently for personal reasons but is available
upon request through email @ vin.chou@mail.utoronto.ca!
